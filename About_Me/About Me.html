        <p> Hello, Welcome! I am pleased to host you. My friends calls me 'Spirit' You can call me that too. <br>
            Anyways, I am a member of The Church of Jesus Chhrist of Latter Days Saint for 5 years now. I am married to my college sweetheart and 
            we have 3 brilliant kids. My wife is from Ghana and I am Nigerian.
        </p>
        <p>This is my 3rd year as a Pathway student, switching from one course to the other insearch of that field of
           study that will choose me as well; I guess I finally found it. Applied Technology is not only a futuristic 
           study interms of development and application, it sucks me in so easily and I am finding it really interesting from day 1.
           Yes I am fascinated by technology in all its forms but I wonder why it took me so long to make this chioce. 
        </p>
        <p>I had my first degree in general business administration and presently work long hours as a customer
            care representative. I am hoping to work at a job that will give me more time with my loved ones,
        that is one reason why I am in this class. With Programing and Web designing skills up my sleeves, I believe I could earn 
    a discent leaving more flexibly.  </p>
    <p>Some of the things I enjoy doing are spending time with my family, gardening, Swimming, and fixing things. 
        I am somewhat of a dexter; spend hours taking things apart and reassemblying them just for the fun of it. I am 
        quite at ease with doing anything that keeps me behind the seen with my fingers and my brains engaged.
    </p>
    <p>I hope we have an amazing semester together as we learn from each other. I am looking forward to make lifelong friend
        from this class. Thank you so much for stopping at my corner.
    </p>
    <p>XOXO from Stanley.</p>
